Overview: We are seeking talented developers and AI enthusiasts to Join Our Company.
create an advanced AI RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) Interview Assistant. By combining RAG with voice recognition and text generation technologies, the tool will enable users to confidently tackle interview scenarios by providing real-time, context-aware answers.




Key Features:

1. Document Upload and Indexing:

Users can upload PDFs, Word documents, or other text files containing company-related materials, such as policies, reports, or FAQs.
The tool will preprocess and index the documents to create a searchable knowledge base.

2. AI-Powered Question Answering:

Utilizing RAG, the model will retrieve relevant information from the uploaded documents to generate accurate and contextual answers to questions.

3. Voice Recognition:

Seamless integration of voice recognition technology to transcribe interview questions in real-time.

4. Real-Time Response Generation:

Text generation capabilities to provide coherent and articulate answers to interview questions.
Ability to adapt the tone and complexity of responses based on user preferences (e.g., formal, conversational).

5. Customizable Knowledge Base:

Users can update the knowledge base with additional documents or manually input data for more comprehensive preparation.






Technical Requirements:

Backend:

AI model for RAG (e.g., OpenAI models, LLaMA, or similar large language models).
Vector-based database for document indexing and retrieval (e.g., Pinecone, Weaviate, or FAISS).
Integration with APIs like Google Speech-to-Text, Whisper, or similar tools.

Frontend:

User-friendly interface built using React, Next.js, or any modern frontend framework.
Integration with cloud storage services for document uploads.





Comprehensive documentation covering:

Installation and setup.

Usage instructions.

Source code hosted in a public/private repository (e.g., GitHub).






Evaluation Criteria:

Accuracy: The AI’s ability to retrieve and generate contextually relevant answers.

Performance: Real-time response generation without significant latency.






Reward: The successful developer/team will be awarded INR5000 along with oportunity to work with Opneblendai with a stipend of 20000INR per month and an oportunity to a full-time remote role with 10LPA CTC based on performance.
